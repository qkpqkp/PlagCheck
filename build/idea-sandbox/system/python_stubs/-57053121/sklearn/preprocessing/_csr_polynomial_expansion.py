def _csr_polynomial_expansion(*args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
    """
    Perform a second-degree polynomial or interaction expansion on a scipy
        compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix. The method used only takes products of
        non-zero features. For a matrix with density d, this results in a speedup
        on the order of d^k where k is the degree of the expansion, assuming all
        rows are of similar density.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        data : nd-array
            The "data" attribute of the input CSR matrix.
    
        indices : nd-array
            The "indices" attribute of the input CSR matrix.
    
        indptr : nd-array
            The "indptr" attribute of the input CSR matrix.
    
        d : int
            The dimensionality of the input CSR matrix.
    
        interaction_only : int
            0 for a polynomial expansion, 1 for an interaction expansion.
    
        degree : int
            The degree of the expansion. This must be either 2 or 3.

    Compressed Sparse Row matrix
    
        This can be instantiated in several ways:
            csr_matrix(D)
                with a dense matrix or rank-2 ndarray D
    
            csr_matrix(S)
                with another sparse matrix S (equivalent to S.tocsr())
    
            csr_matrix((M, N), [dtype])
                to construct an empty matrix with shape (M, N)
                dtype is optional, defaulting to dtype='d'.
    
            csr_matrix((data, (row_ind, col_ind)), [shape=(M, N)])
                where ``data``, ``row_ind`` and ``col_ind`` satisfy the
                relationship ``a[row_ind[k], col_ind[k]] = data[k]``.
    
            csr_matrix((data, indices, indptr), [shape=(M, N)])
                is the standard CSR representation where the column indices for
                row i are stored in ``indices[indptr[i]:indptr[i+1]]`` and their
                corresponding values are stored in ``data[indptr[i]:indptr[i+1]]``.
                If the shape parameter is not supplied, the matrix dimensions
                are inferred from the index arrays.
    
        Attributes
        ----------
        dtype : dtype
            Data type of the matrix
        shape : 2-tuple
            Shape of the matrix
        ndim : int
            Number of dimensions (this is always 2)
        nnz
            Number of nonzero elements
        data
            CSR format data array of the matrix
        indices
            CSR format index array of the matrix
        indptr
            CSR format index pointer array of the matrix
        has_sorted_indices
            Whether indices are sorted
    
        Notes
        -----
    
        Sparse matrices can be used in arithmetic operations: they support
        addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and matrix power.
    
        Advantages of the CSR format
          - efficient arithmetic operations CSR + CSR, CSR * CSR, etc.
          - efficient row slicing
          - fast matrix vector products
    
        Disadvantages of the CSR format
          - slow column slicing operations (consider CSC)
          - changes to the sparsity structure are expensive (consider LIL or DOK)
    
        Examples
        --------
    
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
        >>> csr_matrix((3, 4), dtype=np.int8).toarray()
        array([[0, 0, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=int8)
    
        >>> row = np.array([0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2])
        >>> col = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2])
        >>> data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
        >>> csr_matrix((data, (row, col)), shape=(3, 3)).toarray()
        array([[1, 0, 2],
               [0, 0, 3],
               [4, 5, 6]])
    
        >>> indptr = np.array([0, 2, 3, 6])
        >>> indices = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2])
        >>> data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
        >>> csr_matrix((data, indices, indptr), shape=(3, 3)).toarray()
        array([[1, 0, 2],
               [0, 0, 3],
               [4, 5, 6]])
    
        As an example of how to construct a CSR matrix incrementally,
        the following snippet builds a term-document matrix from texts:
    
        >>> docs = [["hello", "world", "hello"], ["goodbye", "cruel", "world"]]
        >>> indptr = [0]
        >>> indices = []
        >>> data = []
        >>> vocabulary = {}
        >>> for d in docs:
        ...     for term in d:
        ...         index = vocabulary.setdefault(term, len(vocabulary))
        ...         indices.append(index)
        ...         data.append(1)
        ...     indptr.append(len(indices))
        ...
        >>> csr_matrix((data, indices, indptr), dtype=int).toarray()
        array([[2, 1, 0, 0],
               [0, 1, 1, 1]])
