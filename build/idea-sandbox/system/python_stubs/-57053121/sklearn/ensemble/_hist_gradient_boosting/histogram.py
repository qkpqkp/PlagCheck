    """
    A Histogram builder... used to build histograms.
    
        A histogram is an array with n_bins entries of type HISTOGRAM_DTYPE. Each
        feature has its own histogram. A histogram contains the sum of gradients
        and hessians of all the samples belonging to each bin.
    
        There are different ways to build a histogram:
        - by subtraction: hist(child) = hist(parent) - hist(sibling)
        - from scratch. In this case we have rountines that update the hessians
          or not (not useful when hessians are constant for some losses e.g.
          least squares). Also, there's a special case for the root which
          contains all the samples, leading to some possible optimizations.
          Overall all the implementations look the same, and are optimized for
          cache hit.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        X_binned : ndarray of int, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            The binned input samples. Must be Fortran-aligned.
        max_bins : int
            The maximum number of bins. Used to define the shape of the
            histograms.
        gradients : ndarray, shape (n_samples,)
            The gradients of each training sample. Those are the gradients of the
            loss w.r.t the predictions, evaluated at iteration i - 1.
        hessians : ndarray, shape (n_samples,)
            The hessians of each training sample. Those are the hessians of the
            loss w.r.t the predictions, evaluated at iteration i - 1.
        hessians_are_constant : bool
            Whether hessians are constant.
    """
    def compute_histograms_brute(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
        """
        Compute the histograms of the node by scanning through all the data.
        
                For a given feature, the complexity is O(n_samples)
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                sample_indices : array of int, shape (n_samples_at_node,)
                    The indices of the samples at the node to split.
        
                Returns
                -------
                histograms : ndarray of HISTOGRAM_DTYPE, shape (n_features, max_bins)
                    The computed histograms of the current node.
        """
        pass

    def compute_histograms_subtraction(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
        """
        Compute the histograms of the node using the subtraction trick.
        
                hist(parent) = hist(left_child) + hist(right_child)
        
                For a given feature, the complexity is O(n_bins). This is much more
                efficient than compute_histograms_brute, but it's only possible for one
                of the siblings.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                parent_histograms : ndarray of HISTOGRAM_DTYPE,                 shape (n_features, max_bins)
                    The histograms of the parent.
                sibling_histograms : ndarray of HISTOGRAM_DTYPE,                 shape (n_features, max_bins)
                    The histograms of the sibling.

                histograms : ndarray of HISTOGRAM_DTYPE, shape(n_features, max_bins)
