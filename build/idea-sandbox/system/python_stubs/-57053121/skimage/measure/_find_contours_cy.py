    Iterate across the given array in a marching-squares fashion,
        looking for segments that cross 'level'. If such a segment is
        found, its coordinates are added to a growing list of segments,
        which is returned by the function.  if vertex_connect_high is
        nonzero, high-values pixels are considered to be face+vertex
        connected into objects; otherwise low-valued pixels are.
