    Common features in univariate interpolation
    
        Deal with input data type and interpolation axis rolling.  The
        actual interpolator can assume the y-data is of shape (n, r) where
        `n` is the number of x-points, and `r` the number of variables,
        and use self.dtype as the y-data type.
    
        Attributes
        ----------
        _y_axis
            Axis along which the interpolation goes in the original array
        _y_extra_shape
            Additional trailing shape of the input arrays, excluding
            the interpolation axis.
        dtype
            Dtype of the y-data arrays. Can be set via set_dtype, which
            forces it to be float or complex.
