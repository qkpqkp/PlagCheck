    .   
    .   The function estimates the intrinsic camera parameters and extrinsic parameters for each of the
    .   views. The algorithm is based on @cite Zhang2000 and @cite BouguetMCT . The coordinates of 3D object
    .   points and their corresponding 2D projections in each view must be specified. That may be achieved
    .   by using an object with a known geometry and easily detectable feature points. Such an object is
    .   called a calibration rig or calibration pattern, and OpenCV has built-in support for a chessboard as
    .   a calibration rig (see findChessboardCorners ). Currently, initialization of intrinsic parameters
    .   (when CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set) is only implemented for planar calibration
    .   patterns (where Z-coordinates of the object points must be all zeros). 3D calibration rigs can also
    .   be used as long as initial cameraMatrix is provided.
    .   
    .   The algorithm performs the following steps:
    .   
    .   -   Compute the initial intrinsic parameters (the option only available for planar calibration
    .       patterns) or read them from the input parameters. The distortion coefficients are all set to
    .       zeros initially unless some of CALIB_FIX_K? are specified.
    .   
    .   -   Estimate the initial camera pose as if the intrinsic parameters have been already known. This is
    .       done using solvePnP .
    .   
    .   -   Run the global Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm to minimize the reprojection error,
    .       that is, the total sum of squared distances between the observed feature points imagePoints and
    .       the projected (using the current estimates for camera parameters and the poses) object points
    .       objectPoints. See projectPoints for details.
    .   
    .   @note
    .      If you use a non-square (=non-NxN) grid and findChessboardCorners for calibration, and
    .       calibrateCamera returns bad values (zero distortion coefficients, an image center very far from
    .       (w/2-0.5,h/2-0.5), and/or large differences between \f$f_x\f$ and \f$f_y\f$ (ratios of 10:1 or more)),
    .       then you have probably used patternSize=cvSize(rows,cols) instead of using

    cvtColor(src, code[, dst[, dstCn]]) -> dst
    .   @brief Converts an image from one color space to another.
    .   
    .   The function converts an input image from one color space to another. In case of a transformation
    .   to-from RGB color space, the order of the channels should be specified explicitly (RGB or BGR). Note
    .   that the default color format in OpenCV is often referred to as RGB but it is actually BGR (the
    .   bytes are reversed). So the first byte in a standard (24-bit) color image will be an 8-bit Blue
    .   component, the second byte will be Green, and the third byte will be Red. The fourth, fifth, and
    .   sixth bytes would then be the second pixel (Blue, then Green, then Red), and so on.
    .   
    .   The conventional ranges for R, G, and B channel values are:
    .   -   0 to 255 for CV_8U images
    .   -   0 to 65535 for CV_16U images
    .   -   0 to 1 for CV_32F images
    .   
    .   In case of linear transformations, the range does not matter. But in case of a non-linear
    .   transformation, an input RGB image should be normalized to the proper value range to get the correct
    .   results, for example, for RGB \f$\rightarrow\f$ L\*u\*v\* transformation. For example, if you have a
    .   32-bit floating-point image directly converted from an 8-bit image without any scaling, then it will
    .   have the 0..255 value range instead of 0..1 assumed by the function. So, before calling #cvtColor ,
    .   you need first to scale the image down:
    .   @code
    .       img *= 1./255;
    .       cvtColor(img, img, COLOR_BGR2Luv);
    .   @endcode
    .   If you use #cvtColor with 8-bit images, the conversion will have some information lost. For many
    .   applications, this will not be noticeable but it is recommended to use 32-bit images in applications
    .   that need the full range of colors or that convert an image before an operation and then convert
    .   back.
    .   
    .   If conversion adds the alpha channel, its value will set to the maximum of corresponding channel
    .   range: 255 for CV_8U, 65535 for CV_16U, 1 for CV_32F.
    .

    .   as the variational problem, primal-dual algorithm then can be used to perform denoising and this is
    .   exactly what is implemented.
    .   
    .   It should be noted, that this implementation was taken from the July 2013 blog entry
    .   @cite MA13 , which also contained (slightly more general) ready-to-use source code on Python.
    .   Subsequently, that code was rewritten on C++ with the usage of openCV by Vadim Pisarevsky at the end
    .   of July 2013 and finally it was slightly adapted by later authors.
    .   
    .   Although the thorough discussion and justification of the algorithm involved may be found in
    .   @cite ChambolleEtAl, it might make sense to skim over it here, following @cite MA13 . To begin
    .   with, we consider the 1-byte gray-level images as the functions from the rectangular domain of
    .   pixels (it may be seen as set
    .   \f$\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\mid 1\leq x\leq n,\;1\leq y\leq m\right\}\f$ for some
    .   \f$m,\;n\in\mathbb{N}\f$) into \f$\{0,1,\dots,255\}\f$. We shall denote the noised images as \f$f_i\f$ and with
    .   this view, given some image \f$x\f$ of the same size, we may measure how bad it is by the formula
    .   
    .   \f[\left\|\left\|\nabla x\right\|\right\| + \lambda\sum_i\left\|\left\|x-f_i\right\|\right\|\f]
    .   
    .   \f$\|\|\cdot\|\|\f$ here denotes \f$L_2\f$-norm and as you see, the first addend states that we want our
    .   image to be smooth (ideally, having zero gradient, thus being constant) and the second states that
    .   we want our result to be close to the observations we've got. If we treat \f$x\f$ as a function, this is
    .   exactly the functional what we seek to minimize and here the Primal-Dual algorithm comes into play.
    .   
    .   @param observations This array should contain one or more noised versions of the image that is to
    .   be restored.
    .   @param result Here the denoised image will be stored. There is no need to do pre-allocation of
    .   storage space, as it will be automatically allocated, if necessary.
    .   @param lambda Corresponds to \f$\lambda\f$ in the formulas above. As it is enlarged, the smooth
    .   (blurred) images are treated more favorably than detailed (but maybe more noised) ones. Roughly
    .   speaking, as it becomes smaller, the result will be more blur but more sever outliers will be
    .   removed.
    .   @param niters Number of iterations that the algorithm will run. Of course, as more iterations as
    .   better, but it is hard to quantitatively refine this statement, so just use the default and

    .           multiple 1D transforms (when using the #DFT_ROWS flag), each row of the output matrix
    .           looks like the first row of the matrix above.
    .   -   If the input array is complex and either #DFT_INVERSE or #DFT_REAL_OUTPUT are not set, the
    .       output is a complex array of the same size as input. The function performs a forward or
    .       inverse 1D or 2D transform of the whole input array or each row of the input array
    .       independently, depending on the flags DFT_INVERSE and DFT_ROWS.
    .   -   When #DFT_INVERSE is set and the input array is real, or it is complex but #DFT_REAL_OUTPUT
    .       is set, the output is a real array of the same size as input. The function performs a 1D or 2D
    .       inverse transformation of the whole input array or each individual row, depending on the flags
    .       #DFT_INVERSE and #DFT_ROWS.
    .   
    .   If #DFT_SCALE is set, the scaling is done after the transformation.
    .   
    .   Unlike dct , the function supports arrays of arbitrary size. But only those arrays are processed
    .   efficiently, whose sizes can be factorized in a product of small prime numbers (2, 3, and 5 in the
    .   current implementation). Such an efficient DFT size can be calculated using the getOptimalDFTSize
    .   method.
    .   
    .   The sample below illustrates how to calculate a DFT-based convolution of two 2D real arrays:
    .   @code
    .       void convolveDFT(InputArray A, InputArray B, OutputArray C)
    .       {
    .           // reallocate the output array if needed
    .           C.create(abs(A.rows - B.rows)+1, abs(A.cols - B.cols)+1, A.type());
    .           Size dftSize;
    .           // calculate the size of DFT transform
    .           dftSize.width = getOptimalDFTSize(A.cols + B.cols - 1);
    .           dftSize.height = getOptimalDFTSize(A.rows + B.rows - 1);
    .   
    .           // allocate temporary buffers and initialize them with 0's
    .           Mat tempA(dftSize, A.type(), Scalar::all(0));
    .           Mat tempB(dftSize, B.type(), Scalar::all(0));
    .   
    .           // copy A and B to the top-left corners of tempA and tempB, respectively
    .           Mat roiA(tempA, Rect(0,0,A.cols,A.rows));
    .           A.copyTo(roiA);
    .           Mat roiB(tempB, Rect(0,0,B.cols,B.rows));
    .           B.copyTo(roiB);
    .   
    .           // now transform the padded A & B in-place;
    .           // use "nonzeroRows" hint for faster processing
    .           dft(tempA, tempA, 0, A.rows);
    .           dft(tempB, tempB, 0, B.rows);
    .   
    .           // multiply the spectrums;
    .           // the function handles packed spectrum representations well
    .           mulSpectrums(tempA, tempB, tempA);
    .   
    .           // transform the product back from the frequency domain.
    .           // Even though all the result rows will be non-zero,
    .           // you need only the first C.rows of them, and thus you
    .           // pass nonzeroRows == C.rows
    .           dft(tempA, tempA, DFT_INVERSE + DFT_SCALE, C.rows);
    .   
    .           // now copy the result back to C.
    .           tempA(Rect(0, 0, C.cols, C.rows)).copyTo(C);
    .   
    .           // all the temporary buffers will be deallocated automatically
    .       }
    .   @endcode
    .   To optimize this sample, consider the following approaches:
    .   -   Since nonzeroRows != 0 is passed to the forward transform calls and since A and B are copied to
    .       the top-left corners of tempA and tempB, respectively, it is not necessary to clear the whole
    .       tempA and tempB. It is only necessary to clear the tempA.cols - A.cols ( tempB.cols - B.cols)
    .       rightmost columns of the matrices.
    .   -   This DFT-based convolution does not have to be applied to the whole big arrays, especially if B
    .       is significantly smaller than A or vice versa. Instead, you can calculate convolution by parts.
    .       To do this, you need to split the output array C into multiple tiles. For each tile, estimate
    .       which parts of A and B are required to calculate convolution in this tile. If the tiles in C are
    .       too small, the speed will decrease a lot because of repeated work. In the ultimate case, when
    .       each tile in C is a single pixel, the algorithm becomes equivalent to the naive convolution
    .       algorithm. If the tiles are too big, the temporary arrays tempA and tempB become too big and
    .       there is also a slowdown because of bad cache locality. So, there is an optimal tile size
    .       somewhere in the middle.
    .   -   If different tiles in C can be calculated in parallel and, thus, the convolution is done by
    .       parts, the loop can be threaded.
    .   
    .   All of the above improvements have been implemented in #matchTemplate and #filter2D . Therefore, by
    .   using them, you can get the performance even better than with the above theoretically optimal
    .   implementation. Though, those two functions actually calculate cross-correlation, not convolution,
    .   so you need to "flip" the second convolution operand B vertically and horizontally using flip .

    .   @brief Calculates the distance to the closest zero pixel for each pixel of the source image.
    .   
    .   The function cv::distanceTransform calculates the approximate or precise distance from every binary
    .   image pixel to the nearest zero pixel. For zero image pixels, the distance will obviously be zero.
    .   
    .   When maskSize == #DIST_MASK_PRECISE and distanceType == #DIST_L2 , the function runs the
    .   algorithm described in @cite Felzenszwalb04 . This algorithm is parallelized with the TBB library.
    .   
    .   In other cases, the algorithm @cite Borgefors86 is used. This means that for a pixel the function
    .   finds the shortest path to the nearest zero pixel consisting of basic shifts: horizontal, vertical,
    .   diagonal, or knight's move (the latest is available for a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask). The overall
    .   distance is calculated as a sum of these basic distances. Since the distance function should be
    .   symmetric, all of the horizontal and vertical shifts must have the same cost (denoted as a ), all
    .   the diagonal shifts must have the same cost (denoted as `b`), and all knight's moves must have the
    .   same cost (denoted as `c`). For the #DIST_C and #DIST_L1 types, the distance is calculated
    .   precisely, whereas for #DIST_L2 (Euclidean distance) the distance can be calculated only with a
    .   relative error (a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask gives more accurate results). For `a`,`b`, and `c`, OpenCV
    .   uses the values suggested in the original paper:
    .   - DIST_L1: `a = 1, b = 2`
    .   - DIST_L2:
    .       - `3 x 3`: `a=0.955, b=1.3693`
    .       - `5 x 5`: `a=1, b=1.4, c=2.1969`
    .   - DIST_C: `a = 1, b = 1`
    .   
    .   Typically, for a fast, coarse distance estimation #DIST_L2, a \f$3\times 3\f$ mask is used. For a
    .   more accurate distance estimation #DIST_L2, a \f$5\times 5\f$ mask or the precise algorithm is used.
    .   Note that both the precise and the approximate algorithms are linear on the number of pixels.
    .   
    .   This variant of the function does not only compute the minimum distance for each pixel \f$(x, y)\f$
    .   but also identifies the nearest connected component consisting of zero pixels
    .   (labelType==#DIST_LABEL_CCOMP) or the nearest zero pixel (labelType==#DIST_LABEL_PIXEL). Index of the
    .   component/pixel is stored in `labels(x, y)`. When labelType==#DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function
    .   automatically finds connected components of zero pixels in the input image and marks them with
    .   distinct labels. When labelType==#DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function scans through the input image and
    .   marks all the zero pixels with distinct labels.
    .   
    .   In this mode, the complexity is still linear. That is, the function provides a very fast way to
    .   compute the Voronoi diagram for a binary image. Currently, the second variant can use only the

    .   inliers only in case of a robust method) with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the
    .   re-projection error even more.
    .   
    .   The methods RANSAC and RHO can handle practically any ratio of outliers but need a threshold to

    .   newCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by #stereoRectify .
    .   
    .   Also, this new camera is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. That, for
    .   example, helps to align two heads of a stereo camera so that the epipolar lines on both images

    .       pyramid, where each next level has 4x less pixels than the previous, but such a big scale factor
    .       will degrade feature matching scores dramatically. On the other hand, too close to 1 scale factor
    .       will mean that to cover certain scale range you will need more pyramid levels and so the speed
    .       will suffer.
    .       @param nlevels The number of pyramid levels. The smallest level will have linear size equal to
    .       input_image_linear_size/pow(scaleFactor, nlevels - firstLevel).

    .       default value 2 means the BRIEF where we take a random point pair and compare their brightnesses,
    .       so we get 0/1 response. Other possible values are 3 and 4. For example, 3 means that we take 3
    .       random points (of course, those point coordinates are random, but they are generated from the
    .       pre-defined seed, so each element of BRIEF descriptor is computed deterministically from the pixel
    .       rectangle), find point of maximum brightness and output index of the winner (0, 1 or 2). Such
    .       output will occupy 2 bits, and therefore it will need a special variant of Hamming distance,
    .       denoted as NORM_HAMMING2 (2 bits per bin). When WTA_K=4, we take 4 random points to compute each
    .       bin (that will also occupy 2 bits with possible values 0, 1, 2 or 3).
    .       @param scoreType The default HARRIS_SCORE means that Harris algorithm is used to rank features
    .       (the score is written to KeyPoint::score and is used to retain best nfeatures features);
    .       FAST_SCORE is alternative value of the parameter that produces slightly less stable keypoints,
    .       but it is a little faster to compute.
    .       @param patchSize size of the patch used by the oriented BRIEF descriptor. Of course, on smaller
    .       pyramid layers the perceived image area covered by a feature will be larger.

    .   At every pixel (X,Y) of the input image (or down-sized input image, see below) the function executes
    .   meanshift iterations, that is, the pixel (X,Y) neighborhood in the joint space-color hyperspace is
    .   considered:
    .   
    .   \f[(x,y): X- \texttt{sp} \le x  \le X+ \texttt{sp} , Y- \texttt{sp} \le y  \le Y+ \texttt{sp} , ||(R,G,B)-(r,g,b)||   \le \texttt{sr}\f]
    .   
    .   where (R,G,B) and (r,g,b) are the vectors of color components at (X,Y) and (x,y), respectively
    .   (though, the algorithm does not depend on the color space used, so any 3-component color space can
    .   be used instead). Over the neighborhood the average spatial value (X',Y') and average color vector
    .   (R',G',B') are found and they act as the neighborhood center on the next iteration:
    .   
    .   \f[(X,Y)~(X',Y'), (R,G,B)~(R',G',B').\f]
    .   
    .   After the iterations over, the color components of the initial pixel (that is, the pixel from where
    .   the iterations started) are set to the final value (average color at the last iteration):
    .   
    .   \f[I(X,Y) <- (R*,G*,B*)\f]
    .   
    .   When maxLevel \> 0, the gaussian pyramid of maxLevel+1 levels is built, and the above procedure is
    .   run on the smallest layer first. After that, the results are propagated to the larger layer and the
    .   iterations are run again only on those pixels where the layer colors differ by more than sr from the
    .   lower-resolution layer of the pyramid. That makes boundaries of color regions sharper. Note that the

    .      -   An example of how to use solvePnP for planar augmented reality can be found at
    .           opencv_source_code/samples/python/plane_ar.py
    .      -   If you are using Python:
    .           - Numpy array slices won't work as input because solvePnP requires contiguous
    .           arrays (enforced by the assertion using cv::Mat::checkVector() around line 55 of
    .           modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
    .           - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
    .           to its calling of cv::undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
    .           which requires 2-channel information.
    .           - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of
    .           it as, e.g., imagePoints, one must effectively copy it into a new array: imagePoints =
    .           np.ascontiguousarray(D[:,:2]).reshape((N,1,2))
    .      -   The methods **SOLVEPNP_DLS** and **SOLVEPNP_UPNP** cannot be used as the current implementations are
    .          unstable and sometimes give completely wrong results. If you pass one of these two
    .          flags, **SOLVEPNP_EPNP** method will be used instead.
    .      -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of **SOLVEPNP_P3P** and **SOLVEPNP_AP3P**
    .          methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
    .          of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
    .      -   With **SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE** method and `useExtrinsicGuess=true`, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
    .          are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the
    .          global solution to converge.
    .      -   With **SOLVEPNP_IPPE** input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
    .      -   With **SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE** this is a special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
    .          Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
    .            - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]

    .   The function estimates transformation between two cameras making a stereo pair. If you have a stereo
    .   camera where the relative position and orientation of two cameras is fixed, and if you computed
    .   poses of an object relative to the first camera and to the second camera, (R1, T1) and (R2, T2),
    .   respectively (this can be done with solvePnP ), then those poses definitely relate to each other.
    .   This means that, given ( \f$R_1\f$,\f$T_1\f$ ), it should be possible to compute ( \f$R_2\f$,\f$T_2\f$ ). You only
    .   need to know the position and orientation of the second camera relative to the first camera. This is
    .   what the described function does. It computes ( \f$R\f$,\f$T\f$ ) so that:
    .   
    .   \f[R_2=R*R_1\f]
    .   \f[T_2=R*T_1 + T,\f]
    .   
    .   Optionally, it computes the essential matrix E:
    .   
    .   \f[E= \vecthreethree{0}{-T_2}{T_1}{T_2}{0}{-T_0}{-T_1}{T_0}{0} *R\f]
    .   
    .   where \f$T_i\f$ are components of the translation vector \f$T\f$ : \f$T=[T_0, T_1, T_2]^T\f$ . And the function
    .   can also compute the fundamental matrix F:
    .   
    .   \f[F = cameraMatrix2^{-T} E cameraMatrix1^{-1}\f]
    .   
    .   Besides the stereo-related information, the function can also perform a full calibration of each of
    .   two cameras. However, due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space and noise in the input
    .   data, the function can diverge from the correct solution. If the intrinsic parameters can be
    .   estimated with high accuracy for each of the cameras individually (for example, using
    .   calibrateCamera ), you are recommended to do so and then pass CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC flag to the
    .   function along with the computed intrinsic parameters. Otherwise, if all the parameters are
    .   estimated at once, it makes sense to restrict some parameters, for example, pass
    .   CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH and CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST flags, which is usually a
    .   reasonable assumption.
    .   
    .   Similarly to calibrateCamera , the function minimizes the total re-projection error for all the
    .   points in all the available views from both cameras. The function returns the final value of the
    .   re-projection error.

    .   @param alpha Free scaling parameter. If it is -1 or absent, the function performs the default
    .   scaling. Otherwise, the parameter should be between 0 and 1. alpha=0 means that the rectified

    .   The function computes the rotation matrices for each camera that (virtually) make both camera image
    .   planes the same plane. Consequently, this makes all the epipolar lines parallel and thus simplifies
    .   the dense stereo correspondence problem. The function takes the matrices computed by stereoCalibrate
    .   as input. As output, it provides two rotation matrices and also two projection matrices in the new
    .   coordinates. The function distinguishes the following two cases:
    .   
    .   -   **Horizontal stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
    .       mainly along the x axis (with possible small vertical shift). In the rectified images, the
    .       corresponding epipolar lines in the left and right cameras are horizontal and have the same
    .       y-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:
    .   
    .       \f[\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix} f & 0 & cx_1 & 0 \\ 0 & f & cy & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\f]

    .   
    .       where \f$T_x\f$ is a horizontal shift between the cameras and \f$cx_1=cx_2\f$ if
    .       CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set.
    .   
    .   -   **Vertical stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
    .       mainly in vertical direction (and probably a bit in the horizontal direction too). The epipolar
    .       lines in the rectified images are vertical and have the same x-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:
    .   
    .       \f[\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix} f & 0 & cx & 0 \\ 0 & f & cy_1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\f]
    .   
    .       \f[\texttt{P2} = \begin{bmatrix} f & 0 & cx & 0 \\ 0 & f & cy_2 & T_y*f \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} ,\f]
    .

    .       set.
    .   
    .   As you can see, the first three columns of P1 and P2 will effectively be the new "rectified" camera

    .   
    .   Polar mapping can be linear or semi-log. Add one of #WarpPolarMode to `flags` to specify the polar mapping mode.
    .   
    .   Linear is the default mode.
    .   
    .   The semilog mapping emulates the human "foveal" vision that permit very high acuity on the line of sight (central vision)
    .   in contrast to peripheral vision where acuity is minor.
    .   
    .   \par Option on `dsize`:
    .   
    .   - if both values in `dsize <=0 ` (default),
    .   the destination image will have (almost) same area of source bounding circle:
    .   \f[\begin{array}{l}
    .   dsize.area  \leftarrow (maxRadius^2 \cdot \Pi) \\
    .   dsize.width = \texttt{cvRound}(maxRadius) \\
    .   dsize.height = \texttt{cvRound}(maxRadius \cdot \Pi) \\
    .   \end{array}\f]
    .   
    .   
    .   - if only `dsize.height <= 0`,
    .   the destination image area will be proportional to the bounding circle area but scaled by `Kx * Kx`:
    .   \f[\begin{array}{l}
    .   dsize.height = \texttt{cvRound}(dsize.width \cdot \Pi) \\
    .   \end{array}
    .   \f]
    .   
    .   - if both values in `dsize > 0 `,
    .   the destination image will have the given size therefore the area of the bounding circle will be scaled to `dsize`.
    .   
    .   
    .   \par Reverse mapping
    .   
    .   You can get reverse mapping adding #WARP_INVERSE_MAP to `flags`
    .   \snippet polar_transforms.cpp InverseMap
    .   
    .   In addiction, to calculate the original coordinate from a polar mapped coordinate \f$(rho, phi)->(x, y)\f$:
    .   \snippet polar_transforms.cpp InverseCoordinate
    .   
    .   @param src Source image.
    .   @param dst Destination image. It will have same type as src.
    .   @param dsize The destination image size (see description for valid options).
    .   @param center The transformation center.
    .   @param maxRadius The radius of the bounding circle to transform. It determines the inverse magnitude scale parameter too.
    .   @param flags A combination of interpolation methods, #InterpolationFlags + #WarpPolarMode.
    .               - Add #WARP_POLAR_LINEAR to select linear polar mapping (default)
    .               - Add #WARP_POLAR_LOG to select semilog polar mapping
    .               - Add #WARP_INVERSE_MAP for reverse mapping.
    .   @note
    .   -  The function can not operate in-place.
    .   -  To calculate magnitude and angle in degrees #cartToPolar is used internally thus angles are measured from 0 to 360 with accuracy about 0.3 degrees.
    .   -  This function uses #remap. Due to current implementation limitations the size of an input and output images should be less than 32767x32767.

    .   algorithm, described in @cite Meyer92 .
    .
