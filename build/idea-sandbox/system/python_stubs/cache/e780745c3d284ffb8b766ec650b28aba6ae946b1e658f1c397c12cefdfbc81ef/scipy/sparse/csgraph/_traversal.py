    """
    breadth_first_order(csgraph, i_start, directed=True, return_predecessors=True)
    
        Return a breadth-first ordering starting with specified node.
    
        Note that a breadth-first order is not unique, but the tree which it
        generates is unique.
    
        .. versionadded:: 0.11.0
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        csgraph : array_like or sparse matrix
            The N x N compressed sparse graph.  The input csgraph will be
            converted to csr format for the calculation.
        i_start : int
            The index of starting node.
        directed : bool, optional
            If True (default), then operate on a directed graph: only
            move from point i to point j along paths csgraph[i, j].
            If False, then find the shortest path on an undirected graph: the
            algorithm can progress from point i to j along csgraph[i, j] or
            csgraph[j, i].
        return_predecessors : bool, optional
            If True (default), then return the predecesor array (see below).
    
        Returns
        -------
        node_array : ndarray, one dimension
            The breadth-first list of nodes, starting with specified node.  The
            length of node_array is the number of nodes reachable from the
            specified node.
        predecessors : ndarray, one dimension
            Returned only if return_predecessors is True.
            The length-N list of predecessors of each node in a breadth-first
            tree.  If node i is in the tree, then its parent is given by
            predecessors[i]. If node i is not in the tree (and for the parent
            node) then predecessors[i] = -9999.

                to construct an empty matrix with shape (M, N)
                dtype is optional, defaulting to dtype='d'.
    
            csr_matrix((data, (row_ind, col_ind)), [shape=(M, N)])
                where ``data``, ``row_ind`` and ``col_ind`` satisfy the
                relationship ``a[row_ind[k], col_ind[k]] = data[k]``.
    
            csr_matrix((data, indices, indptr), [shape=(M, N)])
                is the standard CSR representation where the column indices for
                row i are stored in ``indices[indptr[i]:indptr[i+1]]`` and their
                corresponding values are stored in ``data[indptr[i]:indptr[i+1]]``.
                If the shape parameter is not supplied, the matrix dimensions
                are inferred from the index arrays.

        Notes
        -----
    
        Sparse matrices can be used in arithmetic operations: they support
        addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and matrix power.
    
        Advantages of the CSR format
          - efficient arithmetic operations CSR + CSR, CSR * CSR, etc.
          - efficient row slicing
          - fast matrix vector products
    
        Disadvantages of the CSR format
          - slow column slicing operations (consider CSC)
          - changes to the sparsity structure are expensive (consider LIL or DOK)
    
        Examples
        --------
    
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
        >>> csr_matrix((3, 4), dtype=np.int8).toarray()
        array([[0, 0, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 0, 0],
               [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=int8)
    
        >>> row = np.array([0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2])
        >>> col = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2])
        >>> data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
        >>> csr_matrix((data, (row, col)), shape=(3, 3)).toarray()
        array([[1, 0, 2],
               [0, 0, 3],
               [4, 5, 6]])
    
        >>> indptr = np.array([0, 2, 3, 6])
        >>> indices = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2])
        >>> data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
        >>> csr_matrix((data, indices, indptr), shape=(3, 3)).toarray()
        array([[1, 0, 2],
               [0, 0, 3],
               [4, 5, 6]])
    
        As an example of how to construct a CSR matrix incrementally,
        the following snippet builds a term-document matrix from texts:
    
        >>> docs = [["hello", "world", "hello"], ["goodbye", "cruel", "world"]]
        >>> indptr = [0]
        >>> indices = []
        >>> data = []
        >>> vocabulary = {}
        >>> for d in docs:
        ...     for term in d:
        ...         index = vocabulary.setdefault(term, len(vocabulary))
        ...         indices.append(index)
        ...         data.append(1)
        ...     indptr.append(len(indices))
        ...
        >>> csr_matrix((data, indices, indptr), dtype=int).toarray()
        array([[2, 1, 0, 0],
               [0, 1, 1, 1]])
